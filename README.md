Personality Prediction with KNN

This project predicts users' personality types (Introvert or Extrovert) based on social media activity using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and synthetic data.

    Average post length

    Number of hashtags

    Emoji usage percentage

    Average posting hour

    Dominant word type (emotional, informative, neutral)

    Personality label (target)

Workflow

    Data preprocessing and label encoding

    Feature scaling with StandardScaler
